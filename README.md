# Diploma-process-prototype
In the course of my thesis, I designed and developed an interactive mockup for the diploma process system using Marvel App, a professional prototyping tool. The mockup consists of 187 unique screens that comprehensively depict each critical stage of the diploma submission process. This mockup reflects the perspectives of both students and academic staff (including thesis supervisors and reviewers) to address their specific needs and expectations.

The goal of the project was to create a highly intuitive and user-friendly interface, ensuring seamless navigation and enhancing the overall user experience. Following the honeycomb model, I focused on aspects such as usability, functionality, accessibility, and visual aesthetics to ensure a well-rounded design. The clickable elements within the mockup allow users to interact realistically with the system, simulating various actions throughout the diploma process, including topic selection, document submission, and review stages.

In line with user feedback collected during interviews, I incorporated additional features such as a detailed FAQ section, instructional modules, and support for anti-plagiarism checks. The mockup was tested for usability, confirming its effectiveness in streamlining the diploma process and reducing the likelihood of errorsâ€‹.
